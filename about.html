<p>I grew up in Fort Lee, New Jersey right next to New York City. Since I was little technology has always been a big part of me from playing on Gameboy Color to Coding Mini websites. I want to grow and gain more experience to one day become a Front-End Developer making my own websites and one day achieving my goal of building a company for myself. </p>
