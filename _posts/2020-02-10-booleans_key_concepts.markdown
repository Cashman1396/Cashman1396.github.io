All throughout coding, we encounter different concepts such as variables, classes, methods, if statements, and Booleans. Each of these concepts play major parts in coding especially Booleans. They are considered on and off switches or as they are commonly known for their true or false values. They are mostly used in arithmetic and logic expressions using operators such as "and", "or" , and "not". Booleans allow programmers to control programming structures and gain more focused and productive results. 

Booleans are used with the idea to control the programs people create as mentioned before they are switches, and comparators used to make coding all easier and to make checks in programs. Ruby uses it the same way as JavaScript, Python, and many other coding languages. They are universal concept to regulate, control, and test. Majority of the time, Booleans are used with if/else statements with arithmetic to see if a block of code is true or false as well as to gain a desired result. They are very useful in everyday life to learn about programs since they used in all kinds of coding languages. Boolean's are able to help programs with checks finding the results that they want.
