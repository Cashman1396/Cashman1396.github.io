When I was young, I have always been infatuated with technology from the dynamic animations that are used in Microsoft Powerpoint to the latest Video Games coming out every month. Technology has always been apart of my life from the beginning. When I was in the fourth grade, I used to be on the computer non-stop, because of my love for technology. As I grew older the interest and love for technology only grew. When I got to college, I took a web development course and created my first website. It was energizing to able to create something for the public to see, and I wanted to do it again. Although my passion at the time was split between game design and web development, I wanted to both. After college, I wanted to make games, but it was hard to do. This prompted me to look into web development more and more. It was then, I created my second website using a website builder. It felt good, but it was not the same as when I made it from scratch. I was recommended by a good friend to look into learning Software Development and becoming a Front-End Developer. I was already excited, I used to be at work looking on Codepen.io and seeing all the amazing things developers would be creating. It was mesmerizing to see what you can do with the knowledge of the web. Software development will be able to help me achieve my goals of connecting more with technology, public, and many more.
